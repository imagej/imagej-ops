# Generated unary and binary arithmetic ops with primitive types.
#
# Many of Java's binary numeric operators only work on ints and longs.
# And still more of them purport to work on bytes and shorts, but
# ultimately return int for the result. And most of Java's unary and
# binary Math functions only work on doubles. So rather than generate
# the entire cross-product of types-plus-operations, we do only those
# that are both valid and consistent regarding the return type.
