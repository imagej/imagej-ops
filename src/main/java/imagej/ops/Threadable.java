/**
 * Interface for {@link Op}s intended to be reused across multiple threads
 * simultaneously.
 * <p>
 * In contrast to a {@link Parallel} Op, which marks an op that executes across
 * multiple threads, a {@code Threadable} op knows how to provide multiple
 * independent versions of itself, each of which will be used from a separate
 * concurrent thread. Note that these versions may be deep copies, shallow
 * copies, or even the same instance every time, depending on the nature of the
 * object.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * In a nutshell: {@link Parallel} ops make use of {@code Threadable} ops for
 * doing their work in a multithreaded way.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * The requirement is merely that two threads using their respective object
 * references as intended will not confuse one another's processing. As a rule
 * of thumb, this means they might share read-only state, but not read-writable
 * state (apart from perhaps lazily initialized state).
 * </p>

	 * <p>
	 * It is expected that subclasses which override this method will narrow the
	 * return type appropriately. We do not enforce this at compile time via
	 * recursive generics due to their complexity: they introduce a host of
	 * typing difficulties.
