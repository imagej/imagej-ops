/**
 * Base class for {@link BinaryHybridOp} implementations that delegate to
 * {@link BinaryComputerOp} implementations.
 * <p>
 * This is mostly useful when the {@link BinaryComputerOp} in question has a
 * generic type as output, which needs to be narrowed to a concrete type for the
 * purposes of the {@link UnaryFunctionOp} portion's return type. In this scenario, a
 * {@link BinaryHybridOp} cannot be used directly with type-safe generics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, a {@link UnaryComputerOp} whose output variable is a
 * {@code T extends RealType<T>} cannot be a {@link UnaryHybridOp} because we do not
 * know at runtime which sort of {@link RealType} matches the caller's {@code T}
 * parameter. However, a separate {@link UnaryFunctionOp} can be created whose output
 * is typed on e.g. {@link DoubleType}, with the computation delegating to the
 * wrapped {@link UnaryComputerOp}.
