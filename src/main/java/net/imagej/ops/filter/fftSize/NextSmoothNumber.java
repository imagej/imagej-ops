/**
 * A class to determine the next <i>k</i>-smooth number (i.e. a number divisible
 * only by prime numbers up to <i>k</i>), given a lower bound <i>n</i>. Based on
 * A. Granville, <i>Smooth numbers: computational number theory and beyond</i>:
 * <blockquote> 5.7. <b>Finding smooth numbers computationally.</b> The obvious
 * way to find y-smooth numbers in (x; x + z) with z &le; x is to initialize an
 * array a[i] := 0 for 1 &le; i &le; z (where a[i] corresponds to x + i). For
 * each successively larger prime power p<sup>j</sup> &le; x + z with p &le; y,
 * determine the smallest i such that p<sup>j</sup> divides x + i and then add
 * log(p) to a[i], a[i + p<sup>j</sup>], a[i + 2p<sup>j</sup>] and so on, up
 * until the end of the array. When weâ€™ve finished, if any a[i] &ge; log(x),
 * then x + i is y-smooth. </blockquote>
