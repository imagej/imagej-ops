/**
 * Base class for {@link UnaryFunctionOp}s that delegate to
 * {@link UnaryComputerOp}s.
 * <p>
 * This is mostly useful when the {@link UnaryComputerOp} in question has a
 * generic type as output, which needs to be narrowed to a concrete type for the
 * purposes of the {@link UnaryFunctionOp} portion's return type. In this
 * scenario, a {@link UnaryHybridCF} cannot be used directly with type-safe
 * generics.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * For example, a {@link UnaryComputerOp} whose output variable is a
 * {@code T extends RealType<T>} cannot be a {@link UnaryHybridCF} because we do
 * not know at runtime which sort of {@link RealType} matches the caller's
 * {@code T} parameter. However, a separate {@link UnaryFunctionOp} can be
 * created whose output is typed on e.g. {@link DoubleType}, with the
 * computation delegating to the wrapped {@link UnaryComputerOp}.
