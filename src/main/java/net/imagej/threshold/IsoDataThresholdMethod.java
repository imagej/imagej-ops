		// S. Calvard, Picture thresholding using an iterative selection method,
		// IEEE Trans. System, Man and Cybernetics, SMC-8 (1978) 630-632.]
		// The procedure divides the image into objects and background by taking an
		// initial threshold, then the averages of the pixels at or below the
		// threshold and pixels above are computed. The averages of those two values
		// are computed, the threshold is incremented and the process is repeated
		// until the threshold is larger than the composite average. That is,
		// threshold = (average background + average objects)/2
		// The code in ImageJ that implements this function is the
		// getAutoThreshold() method in the ImageProcessor class.

		// The algorithm implemented in NIH Image sets the threshold as that grey
		// value, G, for which the average of the averages of the grey values
		// below and above G is equal to G. It does this by initialising G to the
		// lowest sensible value and iterating:

		// L = the average grey value of pixels with intensities < G
		// H = the average grey value of pixels with intensities > G
		// is G = (L + H)/2?
		// yes => exit
		// no => increment G and repeat
		//
		// There is a discrepancy with IJ because of slightly different methods
